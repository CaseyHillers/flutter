#
# Required properties:
# * name: human readable, unique string identifier that describes the target
# * recipe: name of the LUCI recipe to run the target on
#       See https://cs.opensource.google/flutter/recipes/+/master:recipes
#
# Optional properties:
# * bringup: boolean hether the target can block the tree. 
#       Targets should be marked as bringup when newly added, until they have
#       soaked for a 25 runs. Tragets that are flaky but not being actively worked
#       on should be hidden because they just cause confusion otherwise.
# * dependencies: List<String> of target names this target is dependent on.
#       This only supports one parent target, and when that target completes
#       successfully, this target will be started.
#       Child targets can reuse artifacts from parent targets.
# * properties: Map<String, String> of properties to pass to recipe
